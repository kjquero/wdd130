            Hello, my name is Kevin John Quero, I am 21 years old and originally from the Philippines.<br>
            I am currently pursuing a Software Development degree at BYU-Idaho Online. I am passionate about coding<br>
            and look forward to learning more about it, especially at a deeper level. I enjoy reading comics, surfing<br>
            the internet, and music. When I'm curious about something, it's hard for me to let it go because I<br>
            constantly feel the urge to learn more about it. Computer Science just turned out to be one of those things.
